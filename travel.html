            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>

            <p>Nanjing is a popular city full of Chinese history and old traditional southern kinds of agriculture. As a northern people from China, Nanjing was the first city that I traveled to the region south of the Yangtze River. Confucius Temple - Qinhuai River is the most famous place to show the beauty of Nanjing.</p>
            
            <p>Confucius temple has many traditional temple agricultures inside and many small shops about traditional Nanjing specialties and popular restaurants. There are also many colorful traditional lanterns which made the night of qinhuai more gorgeous. People can also take the “Hua Fang” ( a special kind of ship) to travel around the river and the whole scenery.  </p>

            <p>The Apostle Islands are a collection of 22 islands in Lake Superior located in the northern region of Wisconsin, USA. Originally inhabited by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people, the islands contain over hundreds of years worth of rich Native American history. In 1970, 21 of the islands and the surrounding waters were designated as the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, a protected area managed by the National Park Service. Lastly, the islands are home to a diverse range of wildlife, including, white-tailed deer, black bears and various bird species.</p>
            <p>There are six lighthouses spread across the islands, making it one of the largest collections of lighthouses in the United States. When the island receives visitors it is viewed as a popular destination for outdoor activities such as kayaking, sailing, hiking and camping. In addition, many people enjoy other activities such as berry picking. Camping is also allowed in 19 of the 21 islands to date.</p>
